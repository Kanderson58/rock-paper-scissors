### Rock Paper Scissors
This project is a rock, paper, scissors game that I built using my Javascript, CSS, and HTML learning.  It makes use of class to class interaction to allow the user to play two versions of the game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer.

### Abstract
I created an Avatar: the Last Airbender themed rock, paper, scissors game.  You can take on the role of the heoric cabbage man and play against the computer in a race against time to save the nations from the incoming Sozin's Comet.  Win three more games than the computer and stop the comet!  You have the option to play classic rock, paper, scissors, or a more complex version.  The complex version fully immerses you in the Avatar world by allowing you to chose if you are an waterbender, earthbender, firebender, airbender, or all of the above - the Avatar himself.

### Context:
This project is the final Mod 1 solo project.  It was assigned on the 10th of January, and was due on the 17th.  Overall, I put 2-3 hours of work into the project each day, for a total of around 20 hours of work time.

### Learning Goals / Achievements
- One of my biggest learning goals was to leave this project feeling confident in DOM versus Data Model manipulation.  I wanted to have a clear understanding of which actions are updating the Data Model, which are updating the DOM, and make sure I knew how to do it in the correct order.  I learned to only display things on the page that the Data Model had stored, and to pass user input directly to the Data Model for updates.
- Another goal was to be more comfortable using flexbox.  Even when I got frustrated, I continued to work with flexbox, and it paid off for this project.
- A final goal I had was to learn how to use the WAVE extension, and incoporate it into all of my future work.  It helped me understand how I was misusing labels, and I spent some time finding and using more semantic HTML elements because of it.
